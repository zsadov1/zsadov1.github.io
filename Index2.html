            <p>My name is Zachary Sadovszky.  I'm a native Richmonder, I grew up in the West End and moved to the city when I was 18.</p>
    
            <p>Upon my arrival into the adult world I was at a stalemate with what I wanted to do.  I did the college thing for a little while and ultimately ended up working full time selling suits.</p>
    
            <p>I found that job unfulfilling and wanted to change my course.  I started teaching at a school for individuals on the Autism Spectrum.  This job was rewarding, but the level of stress proved to be too much.</p>
    
            <p>I transitioned to teaching neuro-typical children.  I taughet pre-school, after-school, and after working a summer camp I realized that wasn't the field for me.</p>
    
            <p>My best friend taught himself to code and got great job after great job with this skill.  I saw an oppurtunity to make a career change and ultimately put me in the place I wanted to be financially.</p>
    
            <p>I downloaded a few apps and with the help of my friend dipped my toes into the water, and found out it wasn't very cold.  I really enjoyed the puzzles and solutions I was able to come up with.</p>
    
            <p>With this new found hobby I decided to take a dive into the water and join the University of Richmond's Full Stack Bootcamp.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not in class or at work I love to skateboard with my friends and play music.</p>
