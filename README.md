## Professional Portfolio

Description
I made this professional portfolio for the University of Richmond Bootcamp Homework #8. I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Font Awesome and Javascript (JQuery) to code this page.  I deployed using Github Pages.

As a web developer, I need to a portfolio site deployed that will show my skills to potential employers and clients to hire me. This site also gives me an opportunity to introduce myself, while also providing a way for employers and clients to reach out to me.
